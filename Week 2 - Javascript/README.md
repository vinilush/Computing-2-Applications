# Week 2 #
## Tuesday ##
This week we will start off getting accustomed to Javascript,
some of the tooling, and similarities and differences from Python
that you will have seen in Computing 1.

There are two tasks to do during the Wednesday tutorial session.
1. Complete your workspace set-up from last week.
1. Open `c1-exam.js` and complete the exercises - this is an adaption of Q6 of the Computing 1 exam by Becky Steward @TheLeadingZero.
