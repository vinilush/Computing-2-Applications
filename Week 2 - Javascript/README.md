# Week 2 #
## Tuesday ##
This week we will start off getting accustomed to Javascript,
some of the tooling, and similarities and differences from Python
that you will have seen in Computing 1.

There are two tasks to do during the Wednesday tutorial session.
1. Complete your workspace set-up from last week.
1. Open `c1-exam.js` and complete the exercises - this is an adaption of Q6 of the Computing 1 exam by Becky Stewart @TheLeadingZero.

## Friday ##
We will look at some of the array methods, particularly
[map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map),
[filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), and
[reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)

These are the starting point for a discussion about functional programming,
and are really powerful as you will see.


## Next Week ##
Next we'll continue with functional programming,
discussing purity, state, and higher order functions.
